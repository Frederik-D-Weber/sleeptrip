Changes in 1-0:

- zero meaning is done in pre_sphere.m and pre_sphere_symm.m, original
  means are returned and put in state.Xmeans
- denoise_avg.m denoising function is added
- mixing matrix (A) and unmixing matrix (B) added to the state
- demos added in the demos directory

Changes in beta-6:

- help text updated in dss_create_state
- renaming and re-organizing sphering and result matrices
- sphering checks if data is already sphered and sets sphering to identity
- structure of denoise_avg simplified


Changes in beta-5:

- function for initializing denoising function to state structure
  (dss_set_desnoising.m)
- predictive gamma function for symmetric approach
- FastICA denoising functions renamed to 'denoise_fica_...'
- iteration reporting function for convergence (report_iteration.m)
- initial guess for W and S
- license -> GPL
- 'whitening' -> 'sphering'
- GUI-interrupt removed
- sphering separated from dss_create_state. (dss_preprocess.m)
- space-interrupt with java


Changes in beta-4:

- 'constant' -> 'scalar'
- parameter query for ortho functions
- parameter query for preprocess functions
- find_peaks inside denoise_avg gets parameters with separate struct parameter
- source dim reduction -> inside preprocess function
- dss_core_pca W=E' -fix
- fixed parameter order in filter denoising functions
- retrieve eigenvalues from pca-dss (state.D)
- fixed deflation quasi-ortho
- misc/create_signals no longer depends on external functions
- global beta function
- copyright texts
- global_beta defined for denoising functions
